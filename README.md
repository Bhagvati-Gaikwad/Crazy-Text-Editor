# Crazy-Text-Editor

A simple Python-based text editor for fun / “crazy” text transformations.

## About

Crazy-Text-Editor is a lightweight Python application that allows you to open, edit and save text files with a twist: you can apply “crazy” text transformations (e.g., weird fonts, Unicode tricks) to make your text look unusual, funky or stylised.

## Features

* Open existing `.txt` files for editing.
* Apply various text transformations (e.g., flip text, weird Unicode fonts, reversed text).
* Save your edited and transformed text back to a file.
* Easy to use and extend (written in Python).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* Basic familiarity with running Python scripts.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhagvati-Gaikwad/Crazy-Text-Editor.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Crazy-Text-Editor
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
4. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   (Replace `main.py` with the actual entry script name if different.)

## Usage

* From the menu or prompt, open a text file you want to edit.
* Make your edits as desired.
* Choose a transformation option to apply “crazy” text effects.
* Save the output to a new file or overwrite the existing one.

## Customising / Extending

* You can add new transformations by editing the `transformations.py` (or equivalent) module.
* Define a new function that takes a string and returns a transformed string, then add an option in the UI.
* You can integrate GUI frameworks (Tkinter, PyQt) if you prefer a graphical interface instead of console.
